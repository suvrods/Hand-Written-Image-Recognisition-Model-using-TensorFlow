# Hand-Written-Image-Recognisition-Model-using-TensorFlow
TensorFlow and Keras are most useful deep learning libraries in modern day world. Created by Google, TensorFlow provides the best visualization using graphical approach, easy debugging nodes using Tensor Board. 
Deep Learning Models are useful for the automation, recognizing image is the first basic and fundamental validation of ANN. Here 'mnist' dataset(default dataset of Keras) is loaded to analyze hand written image patterns and after creating the model it successfully predicted the outcome with accuracy almost 97%
